============================================================
 Script to add build targets for texinfo in Sphinx Makefile
============================================================

Sphinx Makefile and conf.py generated by old version does not contain
settings for texinfo.  This script adds the settings.  You may need
to fix it by hand, but it gives a good starting point.

Usage
=====

Just run the script at repository root::

    PATH/TO/sphinx_add_texinfo.py
